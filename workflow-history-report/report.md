## Method

Each section fixes both independent dimensions: gh-aw source (`main` or combined stable/pre-release `released`) and execution mode (`inference` or `samples`). Only overall-successful `workflow_dispatch` runs with a successful `agent` job are included. Candidate regression baselines use up to ten preceding observations from the same section and step; displayed regression episodes are limited to the six weeks before report generation. A step is graphed when it has a sustained cost, recent slowdown, or recent regression. Runs with missing compiler metadata remain in CSV/JSON but are excluded from graphs.

For inference runs, `Execute GitHub Copilot CLI` is additionally split using timestamped runtime markers: **AWF startup** is step start to the AWF agent-container entrypoint, **harness startup** is that entrypoint to the first Copilot process start, and **Copilot process** is the first process start through the final process close (including retries and retry delays). Cleanup after process close remains visible only in the full step duration, while unavailable markers produce no phase value.
